# Alice: The AI Chief of Staff

**One founder. Zero employees. Full executive team.**

Alice is an autonomous AI Chief of Staff built on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com), running in production since January 2026. She manages email, sprints, vendor sourcing, overnight builds, meeting processing, and 47+ automated workflows — all on a MacBook Pro, for about $3/day.

This isn't a chatbot. This isn't a demo. This is a solo founder running a creative agency and DTC brand with an AI executive team that works 24/7, learns from every failure, and gets measurably smarter every week.

## Why This Exists

The gap between "people who use ChatGPT" and "people who run AI agents" is about to become the most important divide in small business. These docs are the blueprint for the second group.

Everything here is from production. Real incidents, real metrics, real failures that became permanent rules. No fabricated numbers, no hypothetical scenarios.

## Who This Is For

- **Founders** who want to run leaner without hiring
- **Operators** drowning in context-switching across 15 tools
- **Builders** who want to see what production AI agent infrastructure actually looks like
- **Anyone** who thinks AI should do more than answer questions in a chat window

---

## The Bottom Line

> The question isn't whether AI can replace your ops team. We already did it. The question is how long you'll keep paying for humans to do work that agents do better, faster, and for 1/100th the cost.
